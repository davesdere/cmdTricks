# cmdTricks
Just a repo of little *.bat scripts to ease life a little...
So little things like a timer triggered this repo, because nothing is free and selling my data against a simple timer wasn't for me.
Every Win 10 comes with Command Line utility and Powershell. Since I'm lazy and grew up in cmd.exe, most of those script will be in cmd.exe.
